        Delve into the world of color blindness, a condition that affects how individuals perceive and interact with the visual world. The core of this assignment revolves around creating statements
        explaining color blindness using Java. Students will utilize Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as class inheritance and interfaces to model different types of color blindness accurately.
    </p>
    <h3>Understanding Types of Color Blindness</h3>
        <p>
            We encourage students to explore the diverse spectrum of color blindness types. It's essential to have a comprehensive understanding of these conditions to effectively model them in code. You
            can find valuable resources with detailed information on different types of color blindness below but feel free to find other reputable sources on your own as well.

            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>The Impact of Technology</h3>
        <p>
            Color blindness can pose unique challenges when it comes to technology. Many aspects of our digital world rely on color cues, from user interface to data visualizations. Students should consider
            the difficulties that individuals with color blindness might encounter when using technology.
        </p>
    <h3>Awareness</h3>
        <p>
            It is crucial to consider how color blindness can impact daily life. Including reading, interpreting data, and using technology. At the end of the assignment, you should reflect on questions
            like "How does color blindness affect people's ability to code?" and "What is something that can be improved upon in Computer Science classes to make it easier for people with color blindness to 
            learn?" to appreciate the real-world implications of their work.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you embark on this assignment, you will not only gain valuable technical skills in Java but also develop a deeper awareness of the challenges faced by those with color vision deficiencies. By
            the end of this assignment, you will be well-equipped to model and understand the diverse world of color blindness and its impact on technology and everyday life.
        </p>


<h2>Object-Oriented Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Class Inheritance</h3>
        <p>
            Class inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming. It allows a new class to reuse the code of an existing class. The new class is known as the subclass, and the existing
            class is called the based class. The subclass inherits all of the attributes and methods of the base class, but it can also have its own, unique attributes and methods as well. Inheriting 
            the attributes and methods of the base class allows for the creation of hierarchical structure classes, with each class extending the functionality of the class before it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inheritance is also useful because it can make your code more reusable and it also reduces the amount of code duplication between two subclasses. There are two main types of inheritance in
            Object-Oriented Programming: single inheritance and multiple inheritance. In single inheritance, a subclass can only inherit from one base class. In multiple inheritance, a subclass inherits
            from multiple base classes. In this assignment, you should only worry about single inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this assignment, we use class inheritance to create a hierarchy of color blindness types. This hierarchy allows us to model various forms of color blindness accurately, building upon a 
            common foundation while customizing attributes and methods for each specific type.
        </p>
        <h4>Why is Inheritance important for this assignment?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Code Reusability: By using class inheritance, we can reuse the code and attributes from a base class for various types of disabilities. This avoids redundancy, making the code more 
                    efficient and easier to maintain.
                </li>
                <li> Hierarchical Structure: Inheritance enables the creation of a hierarchical structure. Each color blindness type inherits characteristics from the base class and extends them to represent
                    its unique features. This ensures a logical and structured representation of the different conditions.
                </li>
                <li> Uniform Interface: Inheritance enforces a consistent interface for the color blindness type. The methods and attributes inherited from the base class maintain a common structure, making
                    it easier for developers to work with and understand the various type.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scalability: If we wanted to add more disabilities or make modification, inheritance simplifies the process. We can create new subclasses without altering the base class, which is critical
                    for maintaining the integrity of the codebase.
                </li>
            </ol>
        <p>At the end of this assignment, please answer the following questions and turn it in with your project.
            <ol>
                <li> What is the purpose of class inheritance in this assignment?</li>
                <li> How does inheritance enhance code reusability and maintainability in the context of this assignment?</li>
                <li>What are the advantages of maintaining a hierarchical structure of classes for the various color blindness types?</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    <h3>Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
            Interfaces are also a fundamental part of Object-Oriented Programming. In this assignment, you use interfaces to define a contract that specifies what methods must be implemented by classes that
            implement the interface. Specifically, you have <b>AssistiveTechnology</b>, <b>DigitalAccessibility</b>, and <b>EnvironmentalAssistance</b>.
        </p>
        <h4>Wht are Interfaces Important for This Assignment?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Forcing Method Implementation: Interfaces ensure that any class implementing them must provide specific methods. In this assignment, these methods define behaviors associated with 
                    recommendations for color blindness assistance, making sure that they are consistent across all classes. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Achieving Multiple Inheritance-like Behavior: Java supports multiple interfaces, allowing a class to implement more than one interface. In the context of your assignment, this is crucial 
                    because it enables classes to inherit and provide behaviors from multiple sources, without the complexity of multiple inheritance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Polymorphism and Flexibility: Interfaces support polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common interface. This flexibility is vital when you 
                    want to work with diverse color blindness types in a uniform way. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>At the end of this assignment, please answer the following questions and turn it in with your project.
                <ol>
                    <li> What is the purpose of interfaces in this assignment?</li>
                    <li> How do interfaces enforce consistency in method implementation across different classes in your assignment?</li>
                    <li>Give an example of how interfaces enhance code modularity and maintainability in this assignment.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
