                    <h4>Braille Background</h4>
                    <p>Braille is a tactile writing system used by people with visual impairment. It is traditionally
                        written with embossed paper.
                        Today, people typically use a braille writer, such as a portable braille notetaker or computer
                        that prints with a braille embosser.
                        As for reading computer screens, braille users have the option of using refreshable braille
                        displays.
                        What makes it refreshable is whenever the user moves their cursor through keyboard or voice
                        commands,
                        the display updates the dots in the braille cells.</p>
                    <h4>The Importance of Building for All</h4>

                        <li>
                            (_ pts) <strong>translator():</strong>
                            Define a function called translator that takes two input parameters, a string and the
                            braille_dictionary.
                            The string should be a normal English sentence that is readable by humans.
                            The dictionary should be the one described above. <br><br>
                            The function should first use the split() function to divide the string into a list of
                            words,
                            it should then iterate through the list of words.
                            If the word is contained in the dictionary (e.g. the Grade 2 Braille words), it should
                            substitute it with
                            the associated Braille character. If the word is not in the dictionary, you should iterate
                            through
                            the word string, character by character. It should find each character in the dictionary and
                            replace it with
                            the substituted braille character in a new list (each original character is the key and the
                            replacement
                            braille character is the value associated with that key in the dictionary).
                            Anything that is not contained in the dictionary (e.g. punctuation marks), should be
                            ignored.
                            The function should return a nested list of Braille characters, with raised dots represented
                            as 1's and flat dots represented as 0's.
                            For example, the function should print the nested list below when given this call:
                            <blockquote style="border: 2px solid #212529; padding: 10px; background-color: #b3d7f8;">

                            (_ pts) <strong>draw_braille_character():</strong>I've given you the skeleton of a function
                            called draw_braille_character
                            that takes one parameter, a list of 0's and 1's corresponding to a Braille character.
                            The function currently iterates through the list and uses a turtle to draw six circles
                            corresponding to the six circles in a Braille character.
                            Update the function to fill in the appropriate circles depending on the input.
                            The raised dots should be represented by filled-in circles and the flat dots should be
                            represented as empty circles.

                            <p>You are given a braille dictionary with numbers 1-9, the alphabet, the words

                                representations. Refer online for examples and cite any outside source used. Here is an
                                example:<br />
                                In Grade 1 Braille: <br />
                                b e c a u s e
                                In Grade 2 Braille: <br />
                                b (contraction for "be") c (contraction for "cause")
                                In Grade 1 Braille, each letter of the word "because" is represented individually with
                                its corresponding Braille cell. However, in Grade 2 Braille, the word "because" is
                                contracted to a shorter form. The letter "e" is omitted, and the contraction "be" and
                                "cause" are used instead.
                                Here's another example for the word "can't":
                                In Grade 1 Braille: <br />
                                c a n ' t

                    <p><strong>assert()</strong> is a special function in Python that checks the equality against the
                        function implemented output and the expected output. This will return true if it's the same
                        output and false if otherwise.</p>
