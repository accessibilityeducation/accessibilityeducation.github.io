        <h1>Important Notes</h1>
    <p>This assignment is an individual assignment because the goal is to help you personally understand the impacts of having or not having accessibility guidelines.</p>
    <p>Document your code with an inline comment with the task number.</p>
    <p>Remember to also submit the reflection questions with the zip file of your code.</p>

    <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
    <p>Upon completing this individual assignment, you will gain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fundamental understanding of the importance of having digital accessibility in the real-world.</li>
        <li>Programming in mySQL that you can apply beyond this class.</li>
        <li>Basic and intermediate mySQL commands including but not limited to SELECT, INNER JOIN, EXISTS, COUNT, WHERE, AND, NOT, AS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are a software engineer at a software company that wants to build technology that is inclusive and accessible. <br>In this programming assignment, you will learn about important cases and statistics around people with disabilities. In order to help you succeed in this assignment, let’s understand critical definitions that will be mentioned throughout this assignment. There are two definitions of disability. There is the medical definition and then there is the social model definition of disability.
</p>
        <p><strong>Medical Disability:</strong> “a disability is any condition of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities (activity limitation) and interact with the world around them (participation restrictions). These include, but not limited to: vision, mental health, social relationships, and more” (CDC). This medical model, however, focuses on what’s wrong with the individual rather than the environment around them. 
</p>
        <p><strong>Social model of disability:</strong> This focuses on what’s wrong with the individual’s environment in response to their disability. Suppose a person with a visual impairment is trying to access a website on a computer. On that computer, there is no screen reader installed. A screen reader helps individuals that are blind or have low vision read the text on a screen.
As such, this is the fault of the technology, not the person. Consequently, people with disabilities can feel isolated, excluded, pitied, and undervalued. As a collective society, we must create inclusive environments that promote equal access.

</p>
        <p><strong>Disability inclusion: </strong>This concept encompasses the idea of equal access. In short, disability inclusion is “making sure everybody has the same opportunities to participate in every aspect of life to the best of their abilities and desires” (CDC).
</p>
        <p><strong>Digital Accessibility:</strong> In light of the example above, “refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, digital tools and technologies, by people with disabilities” (Georgetown Law)</p>

        <p>Additionally, this data comes from real sources across the World Health Organization (WHO) and more. In the tables, you will see links to the sources in the last column. By learning about these facts, you will better understand the importance of inclusivity for different groups of people. </p>
    <h2>Getting Started with the Assignment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">Download mySQL workbench (https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)</a></li>
        <li>Download the skeleton code called databaseassignmentSKELETON.sql </li>
    </ul>



        <h2>Database Schema</h2>
          <p>Tables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Social_and_Societal_Table explains various cases specifically talking about the different inequalities people with disabilities may experience.</li>
        <li>The Laws_and_Regulations_Table explains various cases containing statistics about legal guidelines around accessibility requirements for ICT products.</li>
        <li>The Industry_Employment_Table details different cases containing statistics about people with disabilities’ experiences in the workforce.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Columns:</p>
    <p>Each table contains the CaseID, the description of the case data (Social_and_Societal, Laws_and_Regulations, Industry_Employment), the source of the case, and the url of the source.</p>

    <h3>Primary Key</h3>
    <p>The primary key is the CaseID which helps us differentiate between different cases.</p>

    <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
    <p>The foreign key is the ContextID which maps to the CaseID in the Human_Ethical_Cases_Table to help us derive new insights from the motivations of needing accessibility.</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
        Write the SQL query, along with the answer to each question below:
   <h3>Task 1</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Count the different web accessibility acts that exist in the dataset.
        Note: An act refers to a measure passed by a legislative body, such as the United States Congress or a state legislature. Acts usually introduce new laws or amend existing ones.
        </li>
        <li>b. What are the factors that contribute to health inequities?</li>
        <li>c. List the four factors that contribute to the health inequities that people with disabilities face
            Note: Health inequity refers to systematic differences in the health status of different population groups. This results in worse health and increased difficulty accessing healthcare for certain groups.  
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Task 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a. In the database, find the definition of “Disabled Access Tax Credit”? 
            (Hint: You will need to use the REGEXP expression to locate the definition.) 
        </li>
        <li>b. What did Accenture discover in their study about companies that hire people with disabilities? 
            (Hint: Search in the Industry_Employment_Table using the relevant keyword.) 
        </li>
        <li>c. What fraction of unemployed respondents with disabilities want to work but are unable to find jobs? 
            (Hint: You’ll also need REGEXP.) 
        </li>
        <li>d. Count all the sources that are from the Pew Research Center. 
            (Hint: Use the COUNT function on the "SourceTitle" column in the relevant tables)</li>
            Then, sort all the sources you find in ascending order by source title.
            AND  write the most interesting fact that you found from a Pew Research Center source.
    </ul>

    <h3>Task 3 Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a. What percentage of companies have someone with a disability as a board director?  </li>
        <li>b. What is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) responsible for?  </li>
        <li>c. What fraction of images on websites have accessibility issues?  </li>
        <li>d. How much money per year are companies without accessible sites losing to their competitors? 
            (Hint: Check out the Industry_Employment_Table) </li>
        <li>e. What is the difference in the 2021 median earnings between people with disabilities and people without disabilities? 
            (Hint: Use the ‘$’ symbol in your string-matching expression.) </li>
        <li>f. Note: The answer to this is not in the database and doesn’t require a query.
            Why is the difference in earnings between people with disabilities and people without disabilities a problem? Find a statement from the United States Department of Labor that addresses this issue. Why is this a problem? Find a contrasting statement to this from the United States Department of Labor. (Hint: Check out the Industry_Employment_Table.  
            Additionally, check out this fact sheet for more help finding the contrasting statement: <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/factsheet-on-persons-with-disabilities.html" target="_blank"> Factsheet on Persons with Disabilities(https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/factsheet-on-persons-with-disabilities.html)</a>.
</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
    <p>There are statistics about the prevalence of disabilities. In order to reflect on what you learn, please write 1-2 paragraphs for the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. What was the most surprising data you found on disability and why?</li>
        <li>b. How has your perspective about people with disabilities and their experiences changed?</li>
        <li>c. Why does learning about these statistics helpdo you think learning about these statistics helps build inclusion? Think about some ways you can be more inclusive to people with disabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Write these in a document called reflection.txt and turn it in along with your solution code.</p>
