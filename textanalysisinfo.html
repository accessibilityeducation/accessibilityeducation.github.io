        <p>Braille was also the first writing system with binary encoding. 
            The system as devised by Louis Braille consists of two parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Character encoding that mapped characters of the alphabet to arrays of six bits.</li>
            <li>The physical representation of those six-bit characters with raised dots in a braille cell.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Within an individual cell, the dot positions are arranged in a three by two grid. 
            A raised dot can appear in any of the six positions, producing sixty-four possible patterns, 
            including one in which there are no raised dots. </p>
        
        <p>A braille letter is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised. 
            The positions are universally numbered, from top to bottom, as 1 to 3 on the left column and 4 to 6 on the right column. 
            For example, dot pattern 1-3-4 describes a cell with three dots raised at the top and bottom of the left column and at 
            the top of the right column: the letter “m” ⡉ </p>

        <p>The following describes some patterns within grade 1 braille:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The first ten letters of the alphabet, “a-j”, use the upper four dot positions: 
                <br> <b>⠁⠃⠉⠙⠑⠋⠛⠓⠊⠚ </b>(black dots in the table below).</li>
            <li>The next ten letters, “k-t”, are similar to “a-j” with an addition of a dot at position 3:
                <br> <b>⠅⠇⠍⠝⠕⠏⠟⠗⠎⠞ </b>(red dots in the table below)</li>
            <li>The next ten letters (the next "decade") are the same again, but with dots also at positions 3 and 6 (green dots in the table below). 
                Here “w” was left out as it was not a part of the official French alphabet during the time Louis Braille was alive.</li>
            <li>A space in braille is represented by a cell with no dots raised.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>(Figure 3) </p>
        <p>Grade 2 braille is just like grade 1 braille, except there are extra braille representations for commonly used words 
            (“for,” “the,” “will”) and letter combinations (“th,” “-ing,” “st”). 
            This makes grade 2 braille a popular choice in most publications as it shortens the number of pages. 
            Here the keys should be strings corresponding to the word (e.g. “us”).
            <b> Note that the final word should actually be “will” not “wil”.</b></p>

            <p>The skeleton code contains a braille_dictionary that contains the braille representations of the 
                alphabet a-z, the numbers 0-9, the space, and grade 2 braille. 
                The keys in the dictionary correspond to the ASCII characters and the values are their Braille representation. 
                The Braille representation is a list of 1's and 0's  with raised dots represented as 1's and flat dots represented as 0's. 
                For example, the key “n” in the dictionary corresponds to the value: [1,0,1,1,1,0]. 
                Note that the numbering starts in the upper left of the braille cell and goes down column one and then column 2.</p>
